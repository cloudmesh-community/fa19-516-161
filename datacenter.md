## E.Datacenter.2.b: Tulip Data City

The Tulip Data City is located in Bangalore, India. It is operated by
Tulip Telecom Ltd and was created in partnership with IBM, and several
other tech firms, at a cost of ~$700 million (1). When it opened in
2012, it was the 3rd largest data center in the world. Today it ranks as
the 10th largest in size at nearly one million sq.ft as well as 10th in
power consumption at 90 MW/yr (2). Power to the Tulip Data City is
supplied by 2 kV substations with a load capacity of 40 MVA (3). There
is full back up capacity. The PUE is currently ~1.5 which climbs to 1.94
at full capacity (3). The annual IT load is 60MW (2). The current cost
of one unit of electricity in Bangalore is Rs 7.55, which equates to
$0.1 (4). Using these figures, the annual cost to operate the Tulip Data
City is roughly $78.5 million (5, 6). The Tulip Data City does not
utilize any renewable energy and thus has a rather large carbon
footprint of 477, 770 tons which equates to 105, 330 CO2 car equivalents
(6).

## E.Datacenter.4: Wind Energy

Wind turbines which supply power to the grid are very large, typically 80 meters or more tall, and are often clustered into large groups at a single location (1). These turbine groups have become known as “wind farms”.  Wind farms can be located on land or in the ocean. Turbines located in the ocean tend to be bigger than those on land. Besides being a clean, renewable and widely available resource, wind energy is also very cost efficient at around 2-6 cents per kilowatt-hour (1). In the US wind power accounts for 6.5% of the total energy production (2). In contrast, Denmark, which has a high proportion of Data Centers, creates 39% of their energy needs via wind power (3). As shown in the table, currently there are relatively few wind-powered data centers worldwide, however some of the major Cloud providers such as Google and Microsoft have made commitments to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing renewable energy credits from wind energy providers. In addition, there a many wind-powered data centers planned or under construction throughout the world.

## E.Datacenter.5: Google renewable energy effort

In 2012 Google made a commitment to eventually utilize 100% renewable
energy for the entire company worldwide, including offices and data
centers (1). It took Google five years to achieve this goal and in doing
so it has become the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the
world, spending $3.5 billion dollars to purchase 2.6 gigawatts over 7
years (1). While Google does directly utilize much of the renewable
energy it purchases, it is not always possible in all its data center
and office locations to connect to renewable energy sources. To offset
this limitation the renewable energy industry has developed a system
where they provide a Renewable Energy Credits or certificate (REC) for
the amount of energy the sell. Google purchases an equivalent value of
RECs to that of the fossil fuel energy consumed throughout the entire
corporation (2). In this way Google can claim they are able to utilize
100% renewable energy. By far the largest amount of renewable energy
Google purchases is wind energy and has many long-term purchase
agreements with wind energy providers in the US Midwest, Northern Europe
and Chile (1, 2).  Recently, Google has announced major investments in
renewable energy data centers in Minnesota, Finland and Denmark worth
close to $2 billion (3-5). Lastly, it is not surprising that Google, a
leading developer of AI algorithms that power its search engine, has
committed major resources to use machine learning to optimize its data
centers (6). The result of these efforts were a 40% reduction in cooling
system energy use and 15% overall reduced energy consumption (6, 7).

## E.Datacenter.8: Microsoft San Antonio Data Center failure

**Date:**		9/4/18 – 9/7/18
**Data Center:**	Microsoft Azure South Central Data Center in San Antonio Tx
**Category:**	Weather-related
**Description:**	Lightning strike caused a voltage spike which damaged a cooling system leading to automatic shutoff of hardware (1,2).	 
**Duration:**	Some Azure services were restored the following day, however it took 80.5 hours for full recovery (2).
**Impact:**  	More than 40 Azure services, including Azure Active Directory, Azure DevOps and Resource Manager were unavailable (2,3). In addition, Office 365 SaaS including Skype, Exchange, SharePoint, Power BI and Teams were also unavailable (2,3). In total it was estimated that >30% of North American Azure users as well as users as far away as western Europe were affected (see map 2, 4, 6). 
**Cost:**		Estimates of the economic impact ranged from $2.1 – $4.5 billion (5).
