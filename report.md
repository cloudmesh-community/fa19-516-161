**Abstract**

**Introduction**
Containerized applications have become the most efficient method for application deployment at dynamic scale. Containers allow for the simplified and separate functions of application development and functionality from deployment and cluster management. Containers also have the advantage over VMs of being lightweight and portable for use with different IaaS, PaaS, private/hybrid clouds and even local operating systems.  Kubernetes is an open source project initially developed at Google. It allows for overall orchestration of cluster management including application/dependencies co-localization, automated app rollouts/batch processing, automated scalability, cluster health monitoring and multi-cloud mobility.
**Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a work flow for efficient, large-scale, batch processing of applications using Kubernetes for use with Azure and Chameleon Cloud clusters. This project (along with other current projects) will also represents one the first uses of Kubernetes in the Cloudmesh architecture. Kubernetes will be utilized for cluster management, Cloudmesh will allow multi-cloud deployments. The SaaS application which will be batched will be time series forecasting using R packages.
